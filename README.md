> Need more complex features? Purchase access to [backpack/pro](https://backpackforlaravel.com/pricing), our closed-source paid add-on. It will add **5 more operations, 10 filters, 28 more fields, 6 more columns and 1 more widget**. We believe it's everything you need to build admin panels of _any_ complexity. And thousands of other Laravel developers agree.

But professionals don't love Backpack just because it's feature-packed. They also love it because it's ridiculously easy to override a functionality. Generally, you just need to create a function with the right name or create a blade file with the right name. Yes, it can be _that_ easy. See why thousands of Laravel professionals have been using Backpack, every day, since 2016.

The GIF above should give you with a good idea about what Backpack will help you build. But you can also see it in action in our [live demo](https://demo.backpackforlaravel.com/admin), to get a deeper understanding of how Backpack admin panels look & feel and the amount of features it provides.

## Getting started

Start with the ["Getting Started" series](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/4.0/introduction) in our docs. We try to nudge you towards creating a Backpack acccount, but you don't _need_ one, if you're just trying it out.

Alternatively, if you don't have 20 minutes right now, subscribe to our [drip email tutorial](https://backpackforlaravel.com/getting-started-emails). You'll receive one email per day, for 5 days, 5 minutes each. By the end, you'll be familiar with how Backpack works, and be able to create admin panels for your Laravel apps.

> ### Security updates and breaking changes
> If you're using Backpack in production, please **[subscribe to the Backpack Newsletter](http://backpackforlaravel.com/newsletter)** so you can find out about any security updates, breaking changes or major features. We never _ever_ share your email with anyone & we try to send as few emails as possible (1-4 emails per year). We hate unsolicited email too. But... you know... you're building an admin panel, security _should_ be something you're up-to-date with.

## License

Starting with v5, Backpack has become open-core. Its features have been separated into two packages:
- Backpack\CRUD is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md) (open-source free software);
- Backpack\Pro is licensed under our [EULA](https://backpackforlaravel.com/eula) (closed-source paid add-on);

Backpack\CRUD is perfect if you're building a simple admin panel - it's packed with features! It's also perfect if you're building an open-source project, the permissive license allows you to do whatever you want.

When your admin panel grows and your needs become more complex, you can purchase our [Backpack\PRO](https://backpackforlaravel.com/products/pro) add-on, which adds A LOT of features for complex use cases (see [list here]([Backpack\Pro](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/features-free-vs-paid))). Our documentation includes instructions on how to use both Backpack\CRUD and Backpack\PRO, with all the PRO features clearly labeled <span class="badge badge-pill badge-info">PRO</span>.

<a name="versioning"></a>
## Versioning

Starting with Backpack v5, all our packages follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Here's what `major.minor.patch` (eg. `5.0.1`) means for Backpack\CRUD:
- `major` - breaking changes, major new features, complete rewrites; released **once a year**, in February; it adds features that were previously impossible and upgrades our dependencies; upgrading is done by following our clear and detailed upgrade guides;
- `minor` - new features, released in backwards-compatible ways; **every few months**; update takes seconds;
- `patch` - bug fixes & small non-breaking changes; historically **every week**; update takes seconds;

When we release a new Backpack\CRUD version, all paid addons receive support for it the same day. And because (1) we release a new version every year and (2) when you buy a Backpack addon, you get access to not only _updates_, but also _upgrades_ (for 12mo), that means that... **any time you buy a Backpack addon, it is very likely that you're not only buying the _current_ version** (`v5` at the moment), **but also the upgrade to the _next version_** (`v6` for example).
